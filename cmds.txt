code is where all system vars are

at the top EXIT_ON_ERR and PRINT_ERR can be defined
if EXIT_ON_ERR is false then when there is a error then we dont exit. if its not defined then it is true
if PRINT_ERR if false then error will not be printed. If EXIT_ON_ERR is true then this is true. By default this is also true

define vars by 
VARNAME is VALUE

if statments are
if VALUE is VALUE {

}
use "also" for and
use "or" for or

functions are defined by

code FUNC_NAME(FUNC_ARGS) {
    using VAR
    CODE
}

requires saying what function to use with "using" key word. Does not need to use "using" with args. args are sperated by "and"

looks for
start {
    CODE
}
for where to start

ablity to buffer commands then run them

code.Buffer.add("CMD")
code.Buffer.remove("CMD")
code.Buffer.run


to output use
code.out("TEXT")
